"""Narrow service API over the derived, cache-only Hungarian Commentary
translation layer -- ``get_translation`` (cache-only) and
``get_or_create_translation`` (cache-or-generate), sitting on top of
``textus_kb.commentary_translation_store`` (SQLite cache) and
``textus_kb.commentary_translation_policy`` (prompt + glossary).

No Streamlit dependency here, mirroring ``commentary_compare.py``'s own
split between orchestration and UI -- the UI layer (the "Eredeti" /
"Magyar fordítás" toggle in ``commentary_ui.py``) is a thin caller on
top of this module, and receives ``generate_fn`` from ``app.py`` exactly
like the compare feature does.

Fail-closed throughout: any failure here (missing/corrupt translation
DB, missing/failing provider, missing section) degrades to "no Hungarian
translation available right now" -- it NEVER touches or blocks the
original, read-only Commentary browsing
(``textus_kb.repositories.commentary_repository``, ``commentary.sqlite3``).
A translation is always DERIVED content: its provenance is traceable
through ``section_id`` back to the exact original section (work/edition/
contributors/upstream source), the same metadata the retrieval-only
cards already display -- never treated as, or displayed as, an original
quotation.
